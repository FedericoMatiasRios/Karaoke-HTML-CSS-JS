1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,400


2
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,233
Nicole to me is kinda of being unique

3
00:00:03,233 --> 00:00:05,999
and being someone who you want to be

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,466
and like how you see yourself ,I guess

5
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:22,266


6
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:24,432


7
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:27,099
She says they're walking in a straight line

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,866
But that's not really her style

9
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:31,666


10
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:31,766


11
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:34,399
They all got the same heartbeat

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,133
But hers is falling behind

13
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:39,566


14
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:39,666


15
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,899
Nothing in this world could

16
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,433
Ever bring them down

17
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:47,233


18
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:49,166
Yeah, they're invincible

19
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,966
And she's just in the background

20
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:53,332


21
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,466
And she says

22
00:00:54,466 --> 00:00:58,299
I wish that I could be like the cool kids

23
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,166
'Cause all the cool kids

24
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,832
They seem to fit in

25
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:05,866
I wish that I could be like the cool kids

26
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:08,366
Like the cool kids

27
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:23,366


28
00:01:23,366 --> 00:01:23,466


29
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:26,066
He says I'm talking with a big smile

30
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:28,499
But they haven't got a clue

31
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:28,600


32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,066


33
00:01:31,066 --> 00:01:33,499
Yeah, they're living the good life

34
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,300
Can't see what he is going through

35
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,933


36
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,866
They're driving fast cars

37
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:44,166
But they don't know where they're going

38
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,199


39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,300
In the fast lane

40
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,066
Living life without knowing

41
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:51,166


42
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,466


43
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:54,199
And he says

44
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,300
I wish that I could be like the cool kids

45
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,933
'Cause all the cool kids

46
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:01,166
They seem to fit in

47
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:04,999
I wish that I could be like the cool kids

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,166
Like the cool kids

49
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:08,332


50
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:12,166
I wish that I could be like the cool kids

51
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,799
'Cause all the cool kids

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,800
They seem to get it

53
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,766
I wish that I could be like the cool kids

54
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:23,032
Like the cool kids

55
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:36,666


56
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,132
And they said

57
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:41,699
I wish that I could be like the cool kids

58
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,266
'Cause all the cool kids

59
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:45,399
They seem to fit in

60
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,133
I wish that I could be like the cool kids

61
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:49,233


62
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:51,899
Like the cool kids

63
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,900


64
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,200
I wish that I could be like the cool kids

65
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,033
'Cause all the cool kids

66
00:02:58,033 --> 00:03:00,299
They seem to fit in

67
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,000
I wish that I could be like the cool kids

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,700
Like the cool kids

69
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,733


70
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:11,066
I wish that I could be like the cool kids

71
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,832
'Cause all the cool kids

72
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,833
They seem to get it

73
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:18,766
I wish that I could be like the cool kids

74
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:18,866


75
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,166
Like the cool kids

76
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:33,566


77
00:03:33,566 --> 00:03:36,966
Like the cool kids

78
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:46,966
