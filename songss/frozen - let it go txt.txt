♪ Let it go, let it go ♪

♪ Can't hold it back anymore ♪

♪ Let it go, let it go ♪

♪ Turn my back and slam the door ♪

♪ The snow glows white
on the mountain tonight ♪

♪ Not a footprint to be seen ♪

♪ A kingdom of isolation ♪

♪ And it looks like I'm the queen ♪

♪ The wind is howling like
this swirling storm inside ♪

♪ Couldn't keep it in,
heaven knows I tried ♪

♪ Don't let them in, don't let them see ♪

♪ Be the good girl you always have to be ♪

♪ Conceal, don't feel,
don't let them know ♪

♪ Well, now they know ♪
